## Introduction

This project leverages modern APIs and web scraping techniques to acquire baseball statistics and player performance data. The acquired data is then processed using advanced sabermetric metrics to gain insights into player performance. The results are presented through dynamic and interactive dashboards built using Dash and Plotly.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two files:

1. `data_acquisition.py`: Contains functions for acquiring baseball statistics data through API calls and web scraping.

2. `sabermetrics_dashboard.py`: Implements high-end sabermetric metrics for in-depth player performance analysis and builds interactive dashboards using Dash and Plotly.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v-code01/baseball-sabermetrics-dashboard.git
